Sudden cardiac arrest kills over 350,000 people every year in the U.S. alone; unfortunately, survival rates have remained at around 10% for decades. Avive is changing the paradigm of response to cardiac arrest emergencies by building a connected platform that empowers bystanders to help and facilitates closer collaboration between emergency responders and healthcare providers. To achieve this, Avive has developed a rapid-response program called the 4-Minute City that involves strategically placing Avive’s automated external defibrillators throughout a city embedded with its connected platform coupled with community training.

仅在美国，每年就有超过 350,000 人死于心脏骤停；不幸的是，几十年来，存活率一直保持在10%左右。Avive正在通过构建一个连接平台，赋予旁观者帮助的能力，并促进紧密合作的应对心脏骤停紧急情况的范式转变，以及紧急响应人员和医疗保健提供者之间的更紧密合作。为了实现这一目标，Avive开发了一项名为“4分钟城市”的快速响应计划，该计划涉及在城市各处策略性地放置Avive的自动体外除颤器，并嵌入其连接平台，配合社区培训。

# TetherLock – next generation tool safety

TetherLock – 下一代工具安全

TetherLock is a tethering system that allows industrial climbers to secure their tools efficiently and safely. By storing unused tools on a base connected to the harness and tethering only the actively used tools, TetherLock streamlines tool handling and reduces clutter. At the core of this is the TetherLock mechanism. The mechanism is integrated into the tools, allowing them to be easily switched out of storage and into active use, and vice versa, in a matter of seconds. During this process, the tool is always connected, which makes it impossible to drop and ensures maximum safety.

TetherLock 是一种系绳系统，可让工业登山者高效、安全地固定他们的工具。通过将未使用的工具存放在与安全带连接的基座上，并仅将经常使用的工具拴在一起，TetherLock简化了工具处理流程，减少了杂乱无章的情况。其核心是 TetherLock 机制。该机制集成在工具中，使它们可以在几秒钟内轻松地从存储状态切换到活动使用状态，反之亦然。在此过程中，工具始终处于连接状态，因此不会掉落并确保最大的安全性。
